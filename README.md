# ðŸ“° News Articles REST API

A simple RESTful API built with Python (or your preferred language) to manage a collection of news articles.  
This API allows clients to retrieve and create articles, but not modify or delete them, ensuring immutability of published content.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a backend for managing news articles with the following fields:

- `id` (Integer): Unique identifier for the article
- `title` (String): Title of the article (max 40 characters)
- `content` (String): Full content of the article
- `author` (String): Author's name
- `category` (String): Article category
- `published_at` (Date): Date the article was published

All fields are **required**.
